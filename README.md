## Wheel Of DooM

- This is a Js logic exercise

- When you push "sacrificar" it will choose every time someone else from the list to sacrifice

- The pictures chosen are actual representations of aztec gods and godesses as they appear in aztec codices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_codices). 

- This civilization has been known by using human sacrifice as a tool, to try to influence it's environment. No need to say that the "Great Tenochtitl√°n" (main city of aztec imperium) contained 300.000 people as by 1519. 
Around 1500 the biggest city in Europe seems to have been Constantinople with 200.000.
